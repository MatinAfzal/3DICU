<h3 align="center">An open source implementation of 3D Computer Universe</h3>

I started programming a computer universe based on voxels in February 2024 and I am trying to make it more complete.   
This project has a custom built-in 3D rendering engine written using OpenGL
Any programmer can use the codes in this project to build his own world or help improve ICU.
